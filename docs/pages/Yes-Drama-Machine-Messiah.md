***

### Intro Machine

***

### Followed by Dark Melody

***

### Change To Up Tempo Acoustic

***

## 1st Verso

***

Run down the street where the glass shows that summer has gone.

Age in the doorways resenting the pace of the dawn.

***

All of us standing in line ...

All of us waiting for time ...

For time, the great healer, the Machine-messiah is born.

***

## 2nd Verso

***

Cables that carry the life to the cities we build.

Threads that link diamonds of life to the satanic mills!

***

Oh! To see it in every way!

And ...

We feel it every day, and know ... that

Maybe we'll change!

Open the chance!

Finally unlock our lessons and alter our stance.

***

Friends make their way ... into systems of chance ...

Friends make their way of escape into systems of chance.

***

Escape to freedom ... I need to be there!

Waiting and watching, the tables are turning.

I'm waiting and watching, I need to be there.

***

I care ... to see them walk away!

And ...

To be there when they ... say

They ...

Will ...

Re-turn!

***

### Oliver Wakeman Interlude

***

### Chris Squire bass rift

***

### Steve Howe instrumental

***

### Tempo Change to Dark Melody

***

### Change To Solemn Tempo Acoustic

***

Machine ...

Machine-messiah.

The mindless ...

Search for a higher.

Comp-troller!

Take me to the fire and hold me!

Show me the strength of your singular ... eye!

***

### Repeat Intro Machine

***

### Change to Up Tempo

***

## 3rd Verso

***

History dictating symptoms of ruling romance.

Claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance.

***

All of us standing in line ...

All of us waiting for time!

To feel it all the way ...

And, to be there when they ... say 

They know that!

***

Maybe we'll change ...

Open the chance!

To finally un-lock our lessons and alter our stance.

***

### Steve Howe Instrumental

***

### Oliver Wakeman short interlude

***

### Return Tempo Change to Dark Melody

***

### Change Back To Solemn Tempo Acoustic

***

### Again Oliver Wakeman short interlude

***

Machine ...

Machine-messiah.

Take me ... into the fire.

***

### Oliver Wakeman short interlude final

***

Hold me ...

Machine- messiah!

And, show me ...

The strength of your singular ... eye.

***

### Close with Intro Machine
