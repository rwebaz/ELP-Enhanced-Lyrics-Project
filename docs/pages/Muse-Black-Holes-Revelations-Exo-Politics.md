## The Black Holes and Revelations Album by Muse, 2006

### Lyrics by Muse ( Guitarist, Bassist, Drummer performing Live at the Bourse du Travail in Delaware, USA 2017, Tuesday, December 1st, In The Present Tour)

## Guitar Rift Intro

***

## Verso One

***

O-pen the skies over me ...

I am wait-ing patient-ly.

I'll wait for a sign.

***

## Verso Two

***

As conspiracies un-wind ...

Will you slam shut or free your mind?

Or, stay hyp-no-tized?

***

## Refrain A1

***

When the Zetas fill the skies ...

Will our leaders tell us why?

Fully loaded satellites ...!

Will drag on nothing, but our minds.

***

## Chorus B1

***

But, I'm waiting patient-ly.

And, I'll wait for the sign.

***

### Instrumental Interlude

***

## Verso Three

***

Carried through the centuries ...

Secrets locked up,

And, loaded on my back!

When it weighs me down.

***

## Refrain A2

***

When the Zetas fill the skies ...

It's just our leaders in disguise!

Fully loaded satellites ...!

Will drag on nothing, but our minds.

***

## Chorus B2

***

Well, I'm waiting patient-ly.

And, I'll wait for the sign.

Yeah!

***

## Chorus B3

***

Well, I'm waiting patient-ly.

And, I'll wait for the sign!

***

### Closing Instrumental
